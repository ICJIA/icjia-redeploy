Today, far too many people dealing with mental health and addiction challenges experience the justice system in lieu of justice itself. We convene this year with purpose and power and love to advocate for the kind of justice struggling individuals and families deserve – a life free from discrimination and stigma, the opportunity to overcome health challenges in pursuit of a fulfilling life, and the right to affordable healthcare that treats the whole person – body, brain and spirit.
Our Leadership Breakfast will honor those who have undertaken the journey to social change in pursuit of mental health justice.
