During this webinar, learn about how the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services collaborates with local CJCCs and learn about initiatives under way in those counties to reduce over-incarceration and reduce the length of stay for people with serious mental illness in jails. Franklin County will discuss its participation in the Stepping Up initiative and Toledo/Lucas County will discuss its participation in the Data Driven Justice Initiative and Safety and Justice Challenge.  You will also hear about the Northwest Ohio Regional Information System (NORIS) which was founded in 1974 to provide records automation and information sharing among jurisdictions in Lucas County.
