  In August of 2017, Governor Rauner signed HB2373, which creates better opportunities for people with criminal records by expanding the number of convictions that are eligible to be sealed under Illinois law. This legislation makes Illinois the nationâ€™s leader in removing collateral consequences for people impacted by the criminal system and focuses on reducing recidivism to ensure that Illinois families can achieve positive outcomes associated with stable housing, access to employment and educational options. Under HB2373, most records can now be sealed, marking a big shift in allowing people to move beyond their past. This two page document provides guidance on using this new law:  https://www.communityrenewalsociety.org/sites/default/files/Sealing_Bill_Expansion_Flyer.pdf
