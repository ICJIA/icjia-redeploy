title: 'Practical Considerations Related to Release and Sentencing for Defendants Who Have Behavioral Health Needs: A Judicial Guide'
short_description: >
  This guide and bench card were informed by a May 2017 convening of judges, psychiatrists, people who
  have behavioral health needs and have been in the justice system, and family members who came
  together to discuss behavioral health care resources and decision making around conditions of
  release and sentencing. The convening was hosted by the CSG Justice Center and the American
  Psychiatric Association Foundation as part of the Judges and Psychiatrists Leadership Initiative, a
  project that supports efforts by judges and psychiatrists to improve judicial, community, and
  systemic responses to people in the criminal justice system who have behavioral health needs.
